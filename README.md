# 📁 File Management System

A simple command-line Python application to **create**, **read**, **edit**, **delete**, and **list** files — all from a single interactive menu.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Create new files
* View all files in the current directory
* Delete existing files
* Read contents of a file
* Append text to a file

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* `Python 3.x`
* Standard Library: `os`

---

🧪 Usage Demo

```bash
File Management System
1. Create a new file
2. View all files
3. Delete file
4. Read file
5. Edit file
6. Exit
```

---

## ⚠️ Notes

* The `read_file()` and `edit_file()` functions currently **hardcode to 'sample.txt'** instead of using the filename passed — you can fix this for full dynamic functionality.
* This app operates in the **current working directory** only.
